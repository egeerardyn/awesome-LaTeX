## Learning LaTeX

Guides how to learn LaTeX


## Distributions

- [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/) - Most common LaTeX distribution for macOS, basically TeXLive with some Mac-specific tools added. ![mac]
- [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) - Most common LaTeX distribution for Unix-like operating systems, including GNU/Linux. Also works on Windows. ![linux] ![windows]
- [MikTeX](https://miktex.org) - Most common LaTeX distribution for Windows, but also available for Mac, Linux or as Docker image.  ![linux] ![windows] ![mac] ![foss]

## Docker Images

When one aims for a ready-to-run LaTeX environment without installing, Docker images might be the choice.

- [reitzig/texlive-docker](https://github.com/reitzig/texlive-docker) - minimal TeXLive system with package installation possibility
- [Island of TeX/texlive](https://gitlab.com/islandoftex/images/texlive) - debian-based full TeXLive system

## Engines

- [pdfTeX](https://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex/) - TeX compiler that produces PDF files immediately instead of DVI files (nowadays, this is the standard compiler for many users). ![foss]
- [XeTeX](http://xetex.sourceforge.net) - TeX compiler that provides better unicode and font support than TeX/pdfTeX (i.e. you can use the  fonts of your operating system instead of only TeX fonts). ![foss]

- [mathTeX](https://ctan.org/pkg/mathtex) - mathTeX is the successor of mimeTeX: it produces nicer-looking images but it requires LaTeX to be installed on your server. ![foss]
- [KaTeX](https://khan.GitHub.io/KaTeX/) - KaTeX is a math rendering library made by Khan Academy focusing on fast load times. All output is processed as plain HTML instead of fixed images. ![foss]
